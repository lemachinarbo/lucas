# Fix

1. When an error such as 'no text available' is returned, it is being logged in the user's history.
2. Language selector
3. Add an option to export JSON history with a user token.
4. Add option to use OPEN AI token

# Plan

## Phase 1: Simple Test (MVP)
- Use the Buddhist emotions dataset JSON as the primary source.
- Modify Lucas’s prompt to pull relevant passages based on detected emotions.
- Ensure responses integrate emotional insights and redirections.

Phase 1: Simple Test (MVP) – Steps
Connect Dataset to Lucas

Ensure Lucas can access the Buddhist emotions dataset (JSON).
Modify the logic so that when an emotion is detected, Lucas pulls the relevant topic and text.
Modify the Prompt

Adjust the LLM prompt to include the retrieved topic and text.
Example:
User feels sadness.
Lucas retrieves: "Dukkha – Suffering is part of life."
Lucas generates feedback incorporating this insight.

Test Responses

Run basic tests by inputting different emotions.
Check if the retrieved insights make sense in context.
Adjust for Coherence

Ensure Lucas’s response sounds natural, not just a raw quote.
If responses feel disjointed, tweak how insights are integrated.
Validate Output

Gather feedback (your own or from testers).
Identify patterns where responses need refinement before moving to smarter retrieval.
Once this phase works, we move to Phase 2.

      }
    },

      "emotions": {
        "joy": { "score": 0.85 }
      }
    }
  ]
}


## Phase 2: Smarter Retrieval
- Use a basic search (keyword matching) to fetch relevant texts.
- Inject those into the prompt dynamically.

## Phase 3: Vector-Based Search (RAG)
- Embed the texts into vectors.
- Store and retrieve the most relevant ones based on user input.
