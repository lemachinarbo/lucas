# Plan

## Phase 1: Simple Test (MVP)
- Use the Buddhist emotions dataset JSON as the primary source.
- Modify Lucasâ€™s prompt to pull relevant passages based on detected emotions.
- Ensure responses integrate emotional insights and redirections.

## Phase 2: Smarter Retrieval
- Use a basic search (keyword matching) to fetch relevant texts.
- Inject those into the prompt dynamically.

## Phase 3: Vector-Based Search (RAG)
- Embed the texts into vectors.
- Store and retrieve the most relevant ones based on user input.
